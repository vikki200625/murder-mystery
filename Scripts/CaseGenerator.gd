class_name CaseGenerator
extends RefCounted
# Procedural murder-case generator.
#
# Builds the *ground truth* for one playthrough: who killed the victim, where,
# when, with what, and - the part that matters most - exactly which room every
# suspect and the victim was standing in for each half-hour slot of the
# evening. Everything the game says about alibis is read out of this table, so
# a suspect can no longer improvise a whereabouts and quietly contradict
# themselves an hour later.
#
# This file is deliberately pure data: no scene tree, no Ollama, no signals,
# no autoload references. That's what makes it testable in bulk - see
# Scripts/CaseGeneratorTest.gd, which generates thousands of cases and asserts
# every constraint below still holds.
#
# The generator is generate-then-validate with retry: it builds a candidate,
# checks it, and throws it away if anything is off. Roughly 4 attempts on
# average, so the whole thing finishes in well under a frame.

# ------------------------------------------------------------- the evening --

## 8 slots of 30 minutes, 8:00pm to midnight.

## Slot 0 is dinner: every suspect AND the victim are in the Dining Room. It
## gives the whole house one shared, agreed reference point ("we all rose from
## dinner at half past"), guarantees the murder can't happen before the party
## has assembled, and starts everyone with one corroborated block.
const DINNER_ROOM := "Dining Room"
const DINNER_SLOTS := 1

## The murder never happens during dinner, and never in the final slot - there
## always has to be a before and an after to reason about.
const MURDER_SLOT_MIN := 2
const MURDER_SLOT_MAX := 6

## Chance a suspect stays put rather than moving on. Guests settle into a room
## for a while; they don't drift every half hour. This is also what keeps the
## prompt small - a schedule is run-length encoded before it's shown to anyone,
## so three slots in the Library become one line, not three. Raise this if the
## model starts struggling to recite schedules; lower it for busier evenings.

# -------------------------------------------------------------- the weapons --

## Each weapon lives somewhere specific. That `home_room` is the single most
## useful clue the generator produces: whoever used it had to have passed
## through that room earlier in the evening, and constraint 6 in generate()
## guarantees the murderer did. It turns "who was in the Study before ten?"
## into a real question with a real answer.
##
## `methods` gates the circumstances a weapon can produce - you can't have a
## struggle with poison, and you can't stage a fall with a duelling pistol.

##
## Splitting on room alone is not enough, and the failure is subtle enough to
## be worth spelling out. Suppose the murderer claims the Kitchen for the half
## hour she was really killing him, and an innocent walks into that same
## Kitchen an hour later. Collapsed by room, the innocent's account reads "the
## Kitchen, 10:30 to midnight, with Victoria" - and the one witness who is
## supposed to break her alibi ends up confirming it, because the block hides
## when he actually arrived. Every case would look solvable to the generator
## and be unwinnable in play.
