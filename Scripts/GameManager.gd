# budgets, not safety nets: every token allowed here is a token the player may
# have to wait for.
#
# 140 is deliberately close to what answers actually are. Measured replies ran
# 13-154 tokens against the old cap of 300, and the prompt asks for 1-3
# sentences (~60 tokens) - so 300 was only ever reachable by a model that had
# started rambling, and the reward for letting it finish was 8.8 seconds of
# waiting for text the player didn't want.

const SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS := 340 # four labeled sections need a bit more room
# Group-scene lines are capped harder than one-on-one answers: a Hall meetup
# costs one sequential request PER attendee for every line the detective says,
# so per-reply length is the entire latency budget. Short, sharp interruptions
# are better drama than paragraphs anyway.
#
# Was 70, justified by observed replies averaging ~35 tokens. The average was
# accurate and the cap was still wrong: an average of 35 says nothing about the
# tail, and it was the tail that kept landing mid-sentence - reliably so for
# Varga, whose entire character instruction is to declaim for several sentences
# before reaching the point. 130 clears two sentences plus a wrap-up even for
# the wordiest suspect in the house.
#
# Raising it costs nothing on a typical line: num_predict is a ceiling, not a
# target, so a 35-token reply still takes 35 tokens. The extra budget is only
# ever spent on the replies that were being cut off - exactly the ones worth
# paying for. Worst case is ~1.7s more per attendee on a reply that genuinely
# runs the full length. If meetups start feeling slow, this is the number to
# bring back down.
const GROUP_MAX_TOKENS := 130

# Cuts generation off the moment the model stops producing the one thing we

# question too is billed for every token of it before we throw it away - and at

# conversation outgrows it the oldest messages are silently dropped - starting
# with the system prompt, since the runner only pins four tokens.
#
# We no longer rely on that behaviour being survivable. HISTORY_TOKEN_BUDGET
# below keeps every history comfortably inside this window and decides for
# itself what gets forgotten; see _compact_history_if_needed().
#
# Group scenes used to fill this window several times faster than private ones,
# because every attendee's line was written into every other attendee's history.

# meetup now costs about what a private interview costs.

# ------------------------------------------------------ history compaction --
#
# When a conversation outgrows num_ctx, Ollama drops the OLDEST messages to make
# room. The runner reports n_keep = 4, meaning four tokens are pinned and
# everything else is fair game - so the first thing evicted is the system
# prompt, and the last thing in the system prompt is YOUR OWN MOVEMENTS LAST
# NIGHT, the block every alibi answer is read off.
#
# There is no error when this happens. Suspects simply start improvising their
# whereabouts again, which is the exact failure CaseGenerator exists to prevent
# and which reads as the model hallucinating rather than as memory loss.
#
# So we decide what gets forgotten, and we never let it be the system prompt.

## that it reproduces exactly.

## The opening ~800 tokens of every suspect's system prompt, byte-for-byte
## identical for all eight of them. Built once per game and reused.
##
## The identical part is not a tidiness exercise - it is the single cheapest
## performance fix in the project. llama.cpp decides how much of a cached
## conversation it can reuse by comparing the new prompt against the resident
## one from the FIRST token and stopping at the first difference. The old
## opening line was "You are role-playing as <name>...", so two suspects'
## prompts diverged at roughly token 6 and everything after it - all of the text
## below, which never differed at all - was re-tokenized and re-processed on
## every switch between characters.
##
## Measured on a 4050: that showed up as 800-1100ms of prompt-eval per turn in a
## Hall meetup versus ~90ms in a one-on-one, and the server log named the cause
## outright ("selected slot by LCP similarity, f_sim_best = 0.683" in a meetup
## against 0.95-0.99 in an interview).
##
## So: everything that is the same for everybody goes here, first, and anything
## carrying a name or a schedule goes in the per-character tail. Adding a
## character-specific detail to this function silently undoes the fix - if you
## need one, put it in _build_character_tail() instead.

## of line, deliberately distinguishable:
##
##   Detective: ...              a private question
##   Marcus: ...                 the subject's own answer
##   [In the hall, in front of Evelyn and Eleanor]
##   Marcus: ...                 the subject speaking publicly
##   [In the hall] Eleanor: ...  another guest, with the subject listening
##
## Where a claim was made is evidence in itself: a story told privately and
## then told differently in front of witnesses is exactly the contradiction the
## detective is hunting for, and the summarizer can only catch it if the two
## are told apart. The last shape is what makes cross-suspect contradictions
## findable at all - without it, each suspect is summarized in isolation and
## nothing can ever disagree.
