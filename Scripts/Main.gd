## How far a wall runs along its own axis, and how far out from a room's centre
## it sits. This is the corner-gap fix, and it is the same one ManorBuilder
## already applies to the upper floor.
##
## Walls used to be CELL long (12) sitting at CELL/2, while rooms are spaced
## PITCH apart (13). Every wall therefore stopped 1.0 short of the next one and
## left a hole exactly where the corner should be, sixteen of them on this
## floor. Measured by flood fill, the widest clear route from outside into a
## room was 0.76m against a 0.80m player capsule: you could see straight out
## through every corner, and only miss walking out by 4cm.
##
## At PITCH the walls sit on the room boundary instead, so each one butts its
## neighbour end to end with neither gap nor overlap - not PITCH + WALL_T, which
## also seals the corners but puts two same-facing coplanar quads in the same
## place at every junction and makes the walls shimmer.
##
## Two things fall out of it. Rooms become symmetric, instead of 0.5 short on
## their south and east sides and 0.5 long on the other two. And the doorway
## waypoint get_room_travel_waypoints() computes - the midpoint between two room
## centres - lands exactly in the opening rather than half a metre past it.

# The Hall doubles as the meetup room: suspects ordered there gather for a
# group confrontation.
#
# The cap counts SUSPECTS, not people - the detective is never an attendee - so
# 2 means a three-handed scene: you and two of them. That's deliberately the
# whole format. A two-hander is the sharpest possible confrontation (one
# accuses, one defends, you referee), a round costs only two sequential Ollama
# calls instead of four, and each suspect's memory fills half as fast. It also
# halves the number of other names in the room that a small model can mistake
# for the detective, which is the failure that kept surfacing at four.

# depends on the value.

# those re-read that suspect's whole history because the room rotates between
# characters and only one KV-cache slot existed. Four attendees measured ~10s of
# dead air per line.
#
# What changed: group lines are no longer copied into every attendee's permanent
# memory (GroupChat renders the scene on demand instead), the system prompt now
# shares a cached prefix across all suspects, and OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=4 gives
# each suspect their own cache slot. See PLAN_DialogueOptimization.md.
